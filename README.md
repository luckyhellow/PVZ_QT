# PVZ_QT
C++ / QT     PVZ game\
A small project for learning C++\
Realized the basic function of plant vs zombie\
First time using C++ object oriented and QT, there will be a lot of shortcomings\
\
warning!:\
  I don't know how to deal with path of file in QT(different with C++), pay attention to the path of level1.txt(C:/level1.txt).\
  If you need it, please do some small amend.\
\
If you want to use exe in bin directly, copy level1.txt to "C:/level1.txt".
